<p>Crimson clover (<i>Trifolium incarnatum</i>) is the most important
winter annual legume of the central section of the Eastern States
(<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). Besides being an excellent hay plant and furnishing an
abundance of early spring pasture, it affords protection to the soil
during the fall, winter, and spring, prevents soil washing, and provides
green manure for soil improvement. This legume has the distinct
advantage of being a heavy producer of seed, which can be
easily harvested and sown without the use of expensive machinery.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 497px;"><a id="fig1"></a>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap"> Figure 1.</span>&mdash;Principal crimson clover region of the United States.</div>
</div>

<p>Crimson clover is a native of Europe and is widely grown in France,
Hungary, and other central and southern European countries. Seed
was introduced into this country as early as 1819, but it was not until
1880 that the plant became of agricultural importance. During the
last 6 years the annual commercial consumption of seed in the United
States has ranged from 2 to 4 million pounds. In addition, large
quantities of home-grown seed are used and handled from farm to
farm.</p>

<p>The common name of this clover is derived from the distinctive
bright crimson color of the blossoms. Other common names, such
as German clover and scarlet clover, are frequently heard in different
localities. In general the leaves and stems of crimson clover resemble
red clover, but are distinguished by the rounding of the tips of the
leaves and a greater covering of hair on both leaves and steins. When
it is planted in the fall the leaves develop from the crown and form a
rosette, which enlarges whenever weather conditions are favorable.
In late spring flower stems develop rapidly and terminate their growth
with elongated flower heads. Seed forms and the plant dies with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the advent of hot summer weather. The seed is yellow, slightly larger,
and more rounding than red clover seed.</p>


<hr class="chap" />


<h2><a id="Adaptation"></a>Adaptation</h2>


<p>Crimson clover is adapted to cool, humid weather and is tolerant
of winter conditions where the temperature does not become severe
or too variable. In this region (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) it should be planted in late
summer or early fall, since early establishment and growth are favorable
to its winter survival. It will thrive on both sandy and clay
soils and is tolerant of ordinary soil acidity. On extremely poor soils,
stands are difficult to obtain and the growth is stunted. The use of
manure and phosphate fertilizers on such soils will improve the chances
of obtaining good stands.</p>

<p>Crimson clover may also be successfully grown as a summer annual
in Maine, northern Michigan, and Minnesota. The winter culture
of this clover may be extended into Kentucky, southern Missouri,
and southern Indiana provided the seed is sown in fertile soil early
in August. Production may be successfully extended southward
with an increase of soil fertility and with seeding delayed until soil-moisture
conditions are favorable.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Seedbed_Preparation" id="Seedbed_Preparation">Seedbed Preparation</a></h2>


<p>The most important and difficult phase of successful production of
crimson clover is getting a stand. Sufficient soil moisture to germinate
the seed and to establish the seedlings is the greatest factor in obtaining
a stand, which when established usually produces a good crop.</p>

<p>Seedings are usually made in late August or early September between
the rows of cultivated crops. Under such conditions an ideal
seedbed is difficult to prepare, therefore careful preparation is necessary.
Furthermore, the crop plants in the row shade the clover seedlings
and seriously compete with them for the available moisture.
Increasing the distance between the rows and planting the row crop
more thinly will afford better opportunity for the establishment of
the clover. When planted between the rows of other crops, the seed
is usually broadcast on the surface and covered by cultivating or
harrowing (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>). Drilling the seed after the soil surface has been
stirred will usually give more complete stands than broadcasting, and
it may be done with a small one-horse drill. The seed should not be
planted more than one-half to three-fourths of an inch deep, respectively,
in clay and sandy soils.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 475px;"><a id="fig2"></a>
<img src="images/fig2.png" width="475" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Seeding crimson clover in corn.</div>
</div>

<p>Crimson clover is often seeded following a grain crop, and this is a
surer method of establishing a stand than planting between the rows
of cultivated crops, providing the seedbed is well prepared. After the
grain crop is removed the soil is plowed or disked and allowed to
settle. This is followed by light harrowing or disking when necessary
to kill weed seedlings. Before the clover is seeded the soil should be
firmly packed, because a loose cloddy seedbed is the forerunner of
failure. The seed may be either drilled or broadcast, but drilling will
give more uniform stands.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Fertilizers" id="Fertilizers">Fertilizers</a></h2>


<p>When the crop is planted on extremely poor soils, good stands and
growth cannot be expected. Such soil conditions may be improved
by the application of manure and phosphate fertilizers or by turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
under such crops as cowpeas, soybeans, or lespedeza. In many soils
of low fertility the use of 50 to 100 pounds per acre of a nitrogen
fertilizer will encourage early seedling growth and establishment.
On the fertile soils of this region crimson clover may be successfully
grown without fertilizer, but on most soils applications of 200 pounds
of phosphate fertilizer per acre are profitable in obtaining stands and
vigorous growth (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). The use of potash is recommended when a
deficiency is known to exist.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 433px;"><a id="fig3"></a>
<img src="images/fig3.png" width="433" height="302" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 3.</span>&mdash;Effect of phosphate application on good soil: Treated (left); untreated (right).</div>
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Seed_Sources" id="Seed_Sources">Seed Sources</a></h2>


<p>Of the total amount of seed normally used approximately 60 percent
is of foreign origin, coming principally from Hungary and France.
Most of the domestic crimson clover seed offered on the market is
produced in south-central Tennessee. While white-flowered strains
and others differing in maturity have been isolated, they are little
used. Claims have been made that locally grown seed is superior to
seed from other sources including that of foreign origin. Further
experiments are needed to determine whether such differences actually
exist.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Rate_and_Time_of_Seeding" id="Rate_and_Time_of_Seeding">Rate and Time of Seeding</a></h2>


<p>Under ordinary conditions 15 to 18 pounds of hulled seed will give
good stands unless there is a deficiency of soil moisture. Depending
upon the amount of foreign material 45 to 60 pounds of unhulled seed
is comparable to a 15-pound seeding rate of hulled seed. Crimson
clover may be sown from the middle of August until October 1 with
the expectation of securing a good stand. The later it is seeded the
less growth can be expected and the more readily winterkilling occurs.
The early establishment of the plants becomes more important as
plantings are extended northward. Seeding crimson clover, if possible,
either immediately before or following heavy rains will increase its
chances of making a stand. The spring planting of crimson clover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
in or south of the Corn Belt usually results in a short, stunted growth
followed by meager blossoming and an unprofitable yield.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Inoculation" id="Inoculation">Inoculation</a></h2>


<p>In many parts of the crimson clover region it is not necessary to
inoculate the seed; but if clover has not been successfully grown on a
soil, inoculation of the seed is good insurance. If the plants are not
inoculated they will develop slowly, become yellow, and die. Inoculated
plants are able to obtain about two-thirds of their nitrogen from
the air through their root nodules. The plants may be artificially
inoculated by applying pure cultures of the bacteria to the seed or
by scattering soil from a field where inoculated crimson clover has
been grown. Two hundred to three hundred pounds per acre of such
soil evenly distributed at seeding time is sufficient.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Unhulled_Seed" id="Unhulled_Seed">Unhulled Seed</a></h2>


<p>The use of unhulled seed offers the distinct advantage of increasing
the chance of obtaining thick stands. With the prevalence of dry
soil conditions, light rainfall does not cause the unhulled seed to
germinate, but hulled seed germinates readily and the seedlings may
die from lack of moisture before they can become established.</p>

<p>Its bulky nature makes unhulled seed more difficult to distribute
uniformly than hulled seed. It must be broadcast and may be
harrowed in. It is also difficult to market and is not generally handled
by the seed trade. But farmers can harvest seed for their own use
and save the expense of having it hulled.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Companion_Crops" id="Companion_Crops">Companion Crops</a></h2>


<p>Rye, vetch, Italian ryegrass, and fall-sown grain crops are often
seeded with crimson clover. Besides making a valuable addition to
the clover (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>), these companion crops help bolster up a thin stand.
Such crops are seeded from one-half to one-third the normal crop rate
and the crimson clover is seeded at the normal rate. Planting is done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
at the same time, but, as a greater depth is required for most of the
seed of the companion crops, two seeding operations are necessary.
In Tennessee, farmers often use a mixture of 5 pounds of red clover
and 10 pounds of crimson clover per acre with excellent results. The
first growth of the mixture may be grazed or harvested for hay or for
crimson clover seed, while the second crop is wholly red clover.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 475px;"><a id="fig4"></a>
<img src="images/fig4.png" width="475" height="323" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 4.</span>&mdash;Crimson clover and rye, an excellent green-manure combination.</div>
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Diseases_and_Insects" id="Diseases_and_Insects">Diseases and Insects</a></h2>


<p>The only serious disease that affects crimson clover is stem rot.
The effect of this disease is seen in the early spring and is characterized
by the plants dying in patches. The stems rot at the surface of
the soil or where they join the crown. The occurrence of continued
damp cool weather during early spring favors the development of the
disease. Exclusion of clover and other legumes from the rotation for
a period of 2 to 5 years is the best control method.</p>

<p>Sandy soils in the southern part of the crimson clover belt are often
infested with nematodes. Nematode injury results in a stunting and
yellowing of the plants and is most prevalent in the southern part of
the region. While the clover-seed chalcid, the pea aphid, and other
insects sometimes become numerous in crimson clover, insects do not
ordinarily cause appreciable damage.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Utilization" id="Utilization">Utilization</a></h2>


<p>Crimson clover grows rapidly in early spring and furnishes an
abundance of early grazing (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>). If planted early and an abundant
fall growth is made, the clover may also be grazed during the fall and
winter months. Such a practice has been successfully followed in
Tennessee, where crimson clover has provided the winter pasturage.
The grazing, however, should be restricted to periods when the soil
is relatively dry, otherwise damage may result from trampling. Animals
grazing on crimson clover seldom bloat; however, it is advisable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
not to turn them into clover fields for the first time when they are
hungry. Bloat is less likely to occur when a mixture of clover and
grass or grain is grazed than when the clover alone is grazed. As
crimson clover reaches maturity the hairs of the heads and stems become
hard and tough. When grazed continuously or when fed as
hay at this stage of maturity large masses of the hairs are liable to
form into hair balls in stomachs of horses and mules. Occasionally
the hair balls are responsible for the death of animals. If small
amounts of other feeds, particularly roughages, are fed along with the
clover, the formation of these balls will be reduced. Cattle, sheep,
and swine do not seem to be affected.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 474px;"><a id="fig5"></a>
<img src="images/fig5.png" width="474" height="301" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 5.</span>&mdash;Crimson clover provides an abundance of early spring grazing.</div>
</div>

<p>Crimson clover makes excellent hay when cut at the early bloom
stage although the yield may be slightly reduced. For maximum
yields it should be harvested in full bloom. The hay is easily cured
either in the swath or in the windrow. Fewer leaves are lost and less
bleaching occurs in windrowed hay. Although yields as high as
2½ tons per acre are not uncommon on fertile soil, 1½ to 2 tons is
an ordinary production.</p>

<p>Crimson clover is an ideal green-manure crop. For the best result
it should be plowed under 2 to 3 weeks before planting the succeeding
crop. This gives sufficient time for decomposition, which is rapid
unless the crop is mature when plowed under. Occasionally, strips
are plowed in which row crops are planted, allowing the clover between
the plowed strips to mature. Seed may be harvested by hand from
the clover between the row crop, and the remaining clover straw
allowed to mat and serve as a mulch, or the entire plant may be permitted
to form a mulch. A volunteer seeding may be secured in this
way, especially in the northern part of this region, but attempts to
follow such a practice should be tried on a small scale until experience
is gained. When used in orchards, crimson clover is often allowed to
mature, after which it is disked into the soil. Occasionally a volunteer
seeding may be obtained in the fall.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Seed_Production" id="Seed_Production">Seed Production</a></h2>


<p>Crimson clover is a prolific seed-producing plant and yields of 5 to
10 bushels per acre are common, depending upon the thickness of the
stand, the amount of growth that is produced, and the care exercised
in harvesting the seed. The florets are self-fertile, but bees are effective
in tripping and transferring the pollen, with a consequent increase
in the number of seed per head. The placing of colonies of honeybees
adjacent to blooming fields will effectively increase pollination. More
seed is usually produced on soils of medium fertility than on rich soils,
since fertile soils seem to stimulate the growth of stems and leaves
at the expense of flower-head development.</p>

<p>Large yields and ease of harvesting crimson clover seed are the
principal reasons why crimson clover is such an ideal legume crop.
Farmers may save seed with very little expense other than their own
labor. When the seed heads are mature they readily shatter and are
easily harvested either by hand stripping or by using horse-drawn homemade
strippers. One bushel of unhulled seed contains about 2 pounds
of hulled seed, and although bulky in nature, it can be easily stored on
the farm until fall.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 478px;"><a id="fig6"></a>
<img src="images/fig6.png" width="478" height="222" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 6.</span>&mdash;Cutting a crimson clover seed crop with a mower equipped with a bunching attachment.</div>
</div>

<p>When the seed is mature the crop is cut with a mower, which may
be equipped with a bunching or windrowing attachment (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) or it
may be harvested with a combine. During wet seasons difficulties in
combining the seed from standing plants may be experienced. Under
such conditions the plants may be cut and windrowed and then
threshed by the combine from the windrow. As crimson clover shatters
easily when ripe, cutting with the mower when the heads are
damp with dew or rain is recommended. If allowed to stand too long
after it is ripe a beating rain will shatter much of the seed. After a
few days of curing, the seed is hulled with an ordinary clover huller or
a grain separator equipped with hulling attachments. The less the
clover is handled, the less seed will be lost by shattering.</p>

<p>Troublesome weeds are encountered in growing crimson clover seed;
field peppergrass (<i>Lepidium campestre</i>) and wintercress (<i>Barbarea
praecox</i>) are probably the worst, as their separation from the clover
seed is difficult. Little barley (<i>Hordeum pusillum</i>) is objectionable in
unhulled seed, and the use of unhulled seed will naturally increase the
prevalence of this weed.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
